# Project Documentation

I fear I may have exceeded the time limit specified in the assignment file. I spent a total of about 10 hours on this project. If you browse my commits on the project, the first commit on that repo illustrates my progress after four hours: I had just figured out the algorithm to convert the provided data into a more data structure.

I then decided I would spend a while longer implementing some kind of basic UI, along with allowing multiple methods of submitting the JSON data to be processed. This may all have been unnecessary, but hopefully it won't count against me. Most of all, I wanted to make a working MVP.

I also spent a fair bit more time implementing error checking and relevant error messages throughout the code, as I find UI feedback to be one of the most important factors of a system.

It should also be noted that I avoided using many frameworks or external stylesheets, with the exceptions of JQuery, Modernizr, and CSS Normalizr. This is because I wanted to focus more on the JSON processing algorithms, rather than setting up all the infrastructure needed for Angular/React/etc. I also avoided using any ES6, since although I am studying this and intend to start using more of its features, I am not as fluent with ES6 as I would like, so I avoided it so as to be pragmatic.

Due to time constraints, there are a number of things I did not get around to doing. I have not yet performed any unit or integration testing, which would've been my next port of call had there been more time. There is also plenty of refactoring that could be done, along with better structuring of the code to facilitate more reusable functions.
